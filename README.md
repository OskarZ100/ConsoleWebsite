Portfolio in the style of a computer terminal 

## Why I made this 
I wanted to make a sort of portfolio website but find trying to come up with unique graphics not to be my strong suit 
so I thought of creating a nice user freindly interactive site where you can input a few different commands
to either learn more about me or change the sites appearance and thought that making one that looked and acted somewhat
like a computer terminal would be a neat challenge

## Things to work on 
Obviously i need to work on my css and making my coding a much neater, and I will focus on this in my next projects 
Although I really like this neat little website I dont think it would work that well as a proffesional portfolio so 
I plan on making a new one when I can improve my css and styling skills


## RUN INSTRUCTIONS
make sure you have some sort of IDE to run this on and then download the files and try to run it locally on your computer
should run smoothly only issues i could think of would be sizing issues with various screen sizes but it was made for fun
# HOPE YOU ENJOY THE SITE
